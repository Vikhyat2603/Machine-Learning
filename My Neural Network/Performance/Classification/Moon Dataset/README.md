# Binary Classification on scikit's make_moons dataset

Dataset includes points belonging to one of two classes that are in the shape of 2 arcs(/'moons') in opposite directions.  
Scikit Docs: [sklearn.datasets.make_moons](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_moons.html)  
Data noise can be adjusted along with number of data points.

Visualisation of dataset, along with Neural Network's predictions for points in the dataset, and general prediction for points around the input space.

#### - RMSE Graph.png:  
Shows RMSE recorded throughout training. (numbers on x-axis represent the iteration at which RMSE is recorded, not epoch)

#### - Result Accuracy Graph.png:
Shows percentage of points correctly classified throughout training, for both training and validation data. (numbers on x-axis represent the iteration at which RMSE is recorded, not epoch)

#### - Training.wmv:
Shows the Neural Network's changes in prediction for points around the input space.
